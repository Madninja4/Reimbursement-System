		  <p>At the beginning of the century, a lone Englishman by the name of Robert E. O. Speedwagon, arrived in the USA and started his own oil business. Because of this he became one of the world's richest men. Speedwagon decided that after his demise, the large sum of his fortune would be used for medical research and wild animal and plant protection. In this organization exists a department called the Supernatural Research Department, which is responsible for supplying the Joestar Family with everything they need. This was the will of Speedwagon, who died in 1952.</p>
